MIT Reviewers,

The .scad files are the coded 3D designs. I used OpenSCAD, a 3D modeling program that uses code in order to model 3D objects.

A 3D view of each part can be found in the .STL folder and clicking on the designs. Most notably are the carriage.stl, platform.stl, bowden\_mount.stl and jhead_mount.stl

Best,
Byron Wasti




SpectraStock
============

A design based on the original Rostock which allows for easy implementation of a Spectra-line driven system.

The frame parts are currently the same as the original Rostock ( https://github.com/jcrocholl/rostock ).
